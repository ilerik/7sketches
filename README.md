# 7sketches
Study material and excersises in applied category theory, using rust programming language.

Inspired by the works of Bartosh Milevsky [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/), Giorgi Japaridze [Computability Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05172.pdf), [Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf) by Brendan Fong and David I. Spivak and [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) project which is community managed knowledge base on Math, Phylosophy and Physics seen from catergorical viewpoint.

Interesting work:

Plan Outline:
Modern Programming Languages ~ Partial Natural Deduction (type semantics)
Simply typed lambda calculus ~ Natural Deduction (proof semantics)
TO.DO ~ Computability Logic (game semantics)
Calculus of Constructions ~ Full Intuitionist Logic (scientific method?)
